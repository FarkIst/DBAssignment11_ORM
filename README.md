# DBAssignment11_ORM

## What we have accomplished
The first part is working as expected, and we have managed to generate both the schema and table creation sql file, and the python classes with the proper relationships

For the second part some things can be improved. We managed to get the whole query structure to work, but the code is very crude and can be improved and abstracted.
